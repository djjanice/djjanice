            <h3>Stories are all around us. They help us make sense of the world, and sometimes we hold on to old stories that don't fit who we are becoming.</h3>
            <h3>Are your stories supporting you? Are you ready to release old stories? Let’s build <i>something euphoric</i> together!</h3>

        <div class="section" id="offerings"><h2>Offerings!</h2>
		<p>I'm still refining my offerings.</p> 
		<p>For now, I'm starting with a <strong>build your own package</strong> custom approach. During our first Consult Call, I'll get to hear what you're looking for and decide whether I can help. Once we decide to work together, we'll sketch out a plan for frequency and number of sessions.</p>
		<h3>Pricing</h3>
		<p>I offer sliding scale pricing. Those who are able to pay on the higher end of the scale are encouraged to do so, which in turn enables me to take on clients who need to pay at the lower end of the scale. Thank you for helping me stay accessible.</p>
		<p>Slide Scale Pricing: $50-150 per session</p></div>

        <div class="section" id="about"><h2>About Me!</h2>
		<p>I originally went to college for graphic design and journalism in 2003. Since then writing and stories have been a consistent thread throughout my life. I once wrote and self-published a book that included all my nieces and nephews in it as a Christmas present. I spent three years as the Editor of <a href="https://www.self-directed.org/tipping-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tipping Points Magazine</a> (2021-2024).
		<p>Becoming a life coach has been rolling around in my mind since at least 2021. It wasn’t until the end of 2024 that I actually started to pursue it in earnest. As much as I wish I had started sooner, I feel much better prepared than I did in 2021 when the idea was just a seedling in my mind.</p>
		<p>I'm excited to learn from you and journey alongside as you reflect and discover if you're still in the right story.</p></div>
